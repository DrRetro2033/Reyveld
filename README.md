# What is Arceus?

Arceus is a brand new CLI save manager and editor, inspired by version control software like Git. It is designed to make an easy to manage location for your saves.

# Features

## Branch Off Into Different Timelines 🌌

With Arceus, you can branch saves into new timelines, so multiple versions of one save can exist at the same time.

## Rollback to Older Saves 🕔

Arceus can rollback saves to older versions, so if you make any mistakes, your original savefile is still intact.

## Keep track of YOUR saves 👥

Multiple people can play the same game even if the game is not designed for switching between different players. All you need to do is create a user profile!

## Go Beyond with Add-Ons 📦

Arceus has Lua built-in, with the help of [lua_dardo](https://pub.dev/packages/lua_dardo). It means that Arceus can be used as a save editor for literally any game!

> [!NOTE]
> In the future, I am planning to add built-in functionalty for easier creation of transfer tools, akin to Pokémon Bank. For now, you are going to need to build your own transfer tools.

## Built-In Hex Editor #️⃣
Arceus has a CLI hex editor that allows you can use to edit saves, see changes, and test Plug-Ins.

## Tiny Size 📁

Arceus does not need any external libraries not already compiled with the app, so Arceus has a small footprint on your computer or app. And as a bonus, no DLLs to worry about!

## Cross Platform 🖥️📱

Arceus can run on any modern device!

## Developer Friendly 🤝

Arceus can be used by any developer in their projects, yes even you! Just don't forget to give credit if you use this in your own project.

# Use Cases

## For Save Editors 📝

The main use case for Arceus is for developers wanting to make a save editor. Arceus can be used in save editors to make it easier to focus on what actually matters, the features.

## For Game Development 💻

Be able to rollback to any point in your game for testing, give items for debugging, or intentionally corrupt your save for edge cases; without having to write debug menus! You could even use Arceus as a backend for writing and reading saves in any engine!

## For Multiple Players 🫂

No matter if a game supports multiple saves or not, Arceus can make it easier to have multiple players have their own save!

## For Achievement Hunting 🏆

Jump from point to point in a game, so you can easily collect every achievement in a game without taking up multiple slots or quicksaves.

## For Reverse Engineering 📋

Binary files can be a bit tricky to find differences in, but Arceus is designed to detect the smallest differences in a file's lifetime.

# Why is it called Arceus?

The reason I called this program is called Arceus is because Arceus is the literal god of Pokémon, and they have the ability to effect time and space. It is also because this is a large compontent of my other project [MudkiPC](https://github.com/Pokemon-Manager/MudkiPC), which is Pokémon related.

# Consider Sponsoring ❤️

I would love to continue working on this for the foreseeable future, however, I am currently in school and this project is a lot of work. Consider sponsoring me on GitHub so I can continue working on this project! If you can't, no worries, you can spread the word about this project instead. Thanks!
